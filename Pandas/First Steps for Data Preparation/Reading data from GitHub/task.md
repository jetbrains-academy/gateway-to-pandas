## Reading data from GitHub

In this task, you will download data from a given GitHub link directly into a pandas DataFrame and perform basic data exploration.

1. Download the data from the given GitHub link [Lupa-Visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GirZ0n/Lupa-Visualization/main/resources/python_imports/data/all/import_stats/PYTHON_3.csv). Load the data into a pandas DataFrame. We will use a loop with a limited number of retries and exception handling for connection errors.
