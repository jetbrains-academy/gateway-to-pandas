## Understanding the Series
In this task, we'll introduce the first of two main data structures at the core of Pandas â€” Series. 

[Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html#pandas.Series) is one-dimensional labeled array, 
it is homogenous and size-immutable, i.e. Series elements must be of the same data type and once created, 
the size of a Series object cannot be changed. You can also see it as the primary building block for a DataFrame, 
making up its rows and columns. We'll explore the key properties of DataFrame in the following tasks. 

Series capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.).
The axis labels are collectively referred to as the `index`. The basic method to create a Series is to call:
```python
s = pd.Series(data, index=index)
```
Here, `data` can be many different things:
- array-like (list, tuple etc.) or Iterable
- 1D [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) object
- a scalar value (like 7)
- a Python dict

The passed `index` is a list of axis labels. 

Series acts very similarly to a `numpy.ndarray` and is a valid argument to most NumPy functions. However, operations such as slicing will also slice the index. If you need an actual ndarray, then use [Series.to_numpy()](http://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.to_numpy.html#pandas.Series.to_numpy) method.

Run the code in `task.py` to see some examples in the output.
