## Choosing Pandas: the Benefits

Why [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is the right tool for the job and 
what makes it so useful for data manipulation and analysis?

 - Pandas is a Python package designed for easy and intuitive manipulation of "relational" or "labeled" data.
 - It can import and manipulate data from different sources, such as Comma-Separated Values (CSV) or Excel files, SQL databases etc.
 - Pandas is widely used and well-supported by the community, with many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.
 - Compared to NumPy (also fast and powerful library for basic operation with data) Pandas allows using str labels instead of integer indexes to access data.

### Prerequisites
Youâ€™ll need to know a bit of Python. For a refresher, see 
the course [Introduction to Python](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16630-introduction-to-python) 
or the official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

It will be a plus if you are already familiar with the NumPy library. For a refresher, see 
the course [Python Libraries - NumPy](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18302-python-libraries--numpy).
