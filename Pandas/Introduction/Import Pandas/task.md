## Import Pandas

To access Pandas and its functions, import it in your Python code like this:
```python
import pandas as pd
```

The imported name is often shortened to `pd` for better readability of code. 
This is a widely adopted convention that you should follow so that anyone 
working with your code can easily understand it.
