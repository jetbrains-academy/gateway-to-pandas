## Create and manipulate a DataFrame

In this task, you create a DataFrame using different input types and perform basic operations to understand the DataFrame structure better.


```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],
    'City': ['Saint Petersburg', 'New York', 'Prague', 'Paphos']
}

print(pd.DataFrame(data))
```
Output:
```text
      Name  Age              City
0    Alice   25  Saint Petersburg
1      Bob   30          New York
2  Charlie   35            Prague
3    David   40            Paphos
```

### Working with columns

You should use indexing operator `[]` to to select columns, perform boolean indexing, or slice rows.

```python
column_age = df['Age']  # Select a single column, the result is Series
print(column_age)
```
Output:
```text
0    25
1    30
2    35
3    40
Name: Age, dtype: int64
```

```python
columns_name_age = df[['Name', 'Age']]  # Select multiple columns, the result is DataFrame
print(columns_name_age)
```
Output:
```text
      Name  Age
0    Alice   25
1      Bob   30
2  Charlie   35
3    David   40
```

```python
rows_1_to_2 = df[1:3]  # Select rows by number, the result is DataFrame
print(rows_1_to_2)
```
Output:
```text
      Name  Age      City
1      Bob   30  New York
2  Charlie   35    Prague
```

Keep in mind that using the `[]`-operator directly on the DataFrame is primarily for column selection and basic row slicing. For more advanced row selection or selecting both rows and columns simultaneously, you should use the `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` functions provided by Pandas.

### Boolean indexing

```python
rows_age_gt_30 = df[df['Age'] > 30]  # Select rows where the values in column 'Age' are greater than 30

print(rows_age_gt_30)
```
Output:
```text
      Name  Age    City
2  Charlie   35  Prague
3    David   40  Paphos
```

### Selection by callable
Now comes the fun part and the brain-bending part: passing in a function for the indexing. These come in very hand when you are chaining operations and the index has different values. It is very common with grouping operations, which we will see later in the course.

Here is an example showing passing in a function that just returns a slice to get the rows from 1 through 3. Of course we donâ€™t need to use a function here, but we are showing it to introduce the concept before completely melting brains.

```python
rows_1_to_2 = df[lambda ignore_df: slice(1,3)]  # same as df[1:3]
print(rows_1_to_2)
```
Output:
```text
      Name  Age      City
1      Bob   30  New York
2  Charlie   35    Prague
```

### Task
1. Add a new column called `Month cost` to the DataFrame with the following values: `[50000, 800000, 200000, 500000]`.
2. Compute the `Annual cost in thousands` and add this column to the DataFrame.

<div class="hint">You could operate with columns as they are numbers. Also use int64 type for column `Annual salary in thousands`.</div>
